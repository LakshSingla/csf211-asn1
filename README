The list is sorted in descending order i.e. head points to the maximum
element in the list (as shown in the sample run in the assignment)

`delete_from_list` deletes the first key found in the list

Although the list is of fixed size (I assumed it because the assignment mentions
MEMROY NOT AVAILABLE ERROR, which can only come if an upperlimit is present on the list),
it can be easily extended programatically.
Modify the preprocessor directive #NO_OF_ELEMS (in global_var.h) from 50 to the limit you want

#NO_OF_ELEMS denotes the maximum capacity of all the lists included
Currently it is set to be 50, i.e. maximum elements of all the lists in the program can
be 50, and maximum no of lists that can be created are 50
